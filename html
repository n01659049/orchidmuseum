                <h2>Appearance: This orchid features thick, olive green leaves with a light texture. The leaves begin
                    folded at the base and then open flat. A mature plant can reach 12 inches in height.<br><br>
                    Growth: Angraecum magdalenae produces multiple basal keikis (growths). These keikis flower after the
                    main plant, extending the flowering period over several months.<br><br>
                    Flowers: The orchid produces two to three large, round, crystalline white flowers. The flowers have
                    a waxy, heavy substance to them and are described as having "an enticing nocturnally spicy
                    fragrance".<br><br>
                    Flowering Time: Flowers appear from late spring to early fall and can last up to 5 weeks.</h2>

                    Distribution: Historically widespread from Chiapas, Mexico, through Guatemala and into Honduras.
